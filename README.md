# Essentials of Computational Epidemiology

Paul Zivich

---------------------------------------

An essential part of quantitative sciences, like epidemiology, is computation. Often there are a variety of different
options to compute a quantity. Having a good understanding of these essential methods provide a foundation to build
complex quantitative analyses. Despite this importance, most curricula ignore these basic computational procedures.

This repository is a collection of tutorials focused on computational aspects of epidemiology to supplement what I see
as a gap in most epidemiologic (and other quantitative sciences) curricula. Through simple examples,
the basic principles of computational procedures common to epidemiologic analyses are reviewed. While the focus is
on epidemiology (as I am an epidemiologist), the ideas and concepts explored here apply to any quantitative science.

While not part of an official course, this repo is made with the idea that it would become an epidemiology course in
the future.

## A note on language

In the tutorials, I code in Python. This is for various reasons: (1) I work mostly in Python, (2) I have
found Python to be quick readable, even to those who don't use it, (3) it is one of the most popular languages for
quantitative sciences (even if epidemiology lags behind), (4) it is free to use, and (5) recoding what I have to a
language you regularly use (e.g., SAS, R, Stata) will be more informative than simply running the code I provide.

I may try to provide code in other languages at some point.
